# flickr gallery

This is a code exercise.

To run locally:

    npm install
    grunt

There is a 'dev mode' available that displays a button that will force fetch fresh data from flickr. This is activated by including a `dev=1` query param. There is also a query param `ls=0` that will force the test for localstorage to fail.
